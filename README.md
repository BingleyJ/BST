Please insert ints ONLY ;) and do so before generating heap. Remember when generating/printing heap position [0] is the size of the heap. 
I had to do this to use a pointer at runtime then re-adjust the array memory as needed. 
Generating Heap deletes the old heap and allocates a new array based on the size of the bst. 

1. 1 = insert int  (Do This first a couple times)
2. 2 = print pre order 
3. 3 = print post order
4. 4 = print in order
5. 5 = Generate Heap (Heap gen, TheHeap[0] # of elements, Fixed bug which overwrote entries.)
6. p = Print Heap 
7. i = Insertion Sort Heap 
8. s = Selection Sort Heap
9. b = Bubble Sort Heap
10. h = Shell Sort Heap
20. q = Quit(WORKS!!!!)
